# WorkOrderGenerator
Information is loade into ArrayLists and Queues from three .csv files. Ticket, Person, Employee, and Customer objects are created from the information extracted from the files. Employees are assigned tickets according to their tier(either 1 or 2). Work order objects are created while assigning tickets to employee objects, and printed to a file.
