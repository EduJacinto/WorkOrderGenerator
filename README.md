# WorkOrderGenerator
 * 	Information is loaded into ArrayLists and Queues from three .csv files. Ticket, Person, 
 *  Employee, and Customer objects are created from the information extracted from the .csv files. 
 *  Employees are then assigned tickets according to which tier they fall under (either tier1 or tier 2).
 *  Work order objects are created while assigning tickets to employees. The work orders, along with 
 *  the information that they hold, are then printed to a new .csv file as well as to the log file. 
 *  When printing to new .csv file and log.txt file is complete, the program is complete and exits.
